# TicTacToe

This is my version of TicTacToe (hyperlinked).

## Technologies used
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript
## Features

My game will include out of this world features.

## Planning & Development

Planning is underway. Development is coming along swimmingly.

## Bugs & Solutions

- ~~Potential bug: How to stop players from choosing the same square?~~  SOLVED (not really)
- ~~D.R.Y bug: Repeating functions for each grid square.~~ SOLVED
- .removeEventListener not working now functions are not hard coded. SOLVED 
    - Adds an attribute to the tile when it's clicked. Cnce that attribute is added, the eventListener ignores that tile.

## Improvement ideas

Make the game good.

## Acknowledgements
